# web-service-generator
this tool can automatically generate spring controllers, services, as well as mappers and entities. apart from that,it can also generate test classes.



this tool is based on mybatis generator and freemaker to generate mappers, entities, controllers, services, and test classes.
the generated code must be used in spring-boot project.
for now, it is only a prototype version. later on, i will add more functions.
